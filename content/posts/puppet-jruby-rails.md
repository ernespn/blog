Summary: How to automate rails with puppet

Following my previous [post of automating pelican]({filename}/posts/puppet-pelican.md) I thought it was a good idea to automate the installation of jruby, rails and postgres along with rbenv, so my system will be tidy up and it will take no time to set up another dev environment if a friend try to help me in my personal project.
